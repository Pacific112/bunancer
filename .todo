[x] Load Balancer with support for different servers
[x] Proxy traffic to single server
[x] Round Robin algorithm
[x] Health checks
  [x] Possibility to add / remove servers from the pool
[x] error handling
[x] Timeouts
[x] External place for config storage
[x] Start test servers in parallel in more clever way - Simple CLI?
  [x] Start detached process
  [x] Keep track of current processes
  [x] Kill process
  [x] Log to files and allow to access logs
[ ] Make sure that it works nicely on browser - no double logs for some reason
[ ] Modularize code please. Make better use of closures and functions
[ ] Should server pool be it's own class / type? It should handle health checks by itself
[ ] Monorepo
[ ] Async / Concurrency support
  [ ] Should counter be locked? How to approach it better
  [ ] Hard requirement is that requests must always go to different servers
  [ ] Is it even needed when written like this? Probably would be needed if async operation between start of the function and counter
[ ] Circuit breaker pattern
[ ] Global timeout settings
[ ] Servers can register themselves in server pool
[ ] CLI:
  [ ] Restart all servers
  [ ] Kill all servers
  [ ] Is this the best way to generate instance id?
  [ ] More interactive CLI
  [ ] More types etc
  [ ] Can I have
[ ] Introduce pino for logging
  [ ] Standard access logs on stub server
[ ] Dashboard with stats:
  [ ] Hono
  [ ] Allows to configure load balancer via RCP
  [ ] Pool / config management
  [ ] Timeout management
  [ ] Debug / teaching mode
    [ ] Extract common logic from CLI to separate lib
    [ ] Displays connected servers in real time
    [ ] Displays them on graph
    [ ] Displays health checks that are made to each server
    [ ] Allows to communicate with test servers in real time
      [ ] Timeout
      [ ] 500
      [ ] shutdown
      [ ] Add new one
[ ] Deployment to fly.io
  [ ] X-Forwarded-IP header or something - to make sure it works
  [ ] Fly launch for
[ ] Security considerations
  [ ] For example should any of the headers be actually removed?
  [ ] OAuth / JWKS / Basic Auth - only load balancer is actually secured
  [ ] Configurable via dashboard
[ ] Changesets -> https://github.com/changesets/changesets
[ ] Should I repeat failed request against different server
[ ] HTTPS support? Out of the box?
[ ] Support for different modules
  [ ] Health Check
  [ ] Rate Limiter
  [ ] Whatever user might need
  [ ] Check nginx modules
[ ] Metrics (Sentry?)
  [ ] Number of connections for each server
[ ] Tests
  [ ] Unit
  [ ] Load testing
[ ] XState maybe?
[ ] Documentation
[ ] Support horizontal scaling
[ ] Support for streaming / different http features?
[ ] Rate Limiter
  [ ] IP only
  [ ] per path config
  [ ] x requests in time
  [ ] Geo IP
  [ ] config live!
[ ] Auth Support
  [ ] JWT
  [ ] OAuth maybe?
[ ] MonoRepo?
[ ] Maybe TCP mode? Bun supports
