[x] Load Balancer with support for different servers
[x] Proxy traffic to single server
[x] Round Robin algorithm
[x] Health checks
  [x] Possibility to add / remove servers from the pool
[x] error handling
[x] Timeouts
[x] External place for config storage
[x] Start test servers in parallel in more clever way - Simple CLI?
  [x] Start detached process
  [x] Keep track of current processes
  [x] Kill process
  [x] Log to files and allow to access logs
[x] Make sure that it works nicely on browser - no double logs for some reason
[x] Async / Concurrency support
  [x] Should counter be locked? How to approach it better
  [x] Hard requirement is that requests must always go to different servers
  [x] Is it even needed when written like this? Probably would be needed if async operation between start of the function and counter
[x] Servers can register themselves in server pool
[x] CLI:
  [x] Kill all servers
  [x] Is this the best way to generate instance id?
  [x] More interactive CLI - use https://github.com/bombshell-dev/clack
  [x] Options:
    [x] Servers -> Logs / Kill / Back
    [x] Add Server -> full config
    [x] Quit
[x] Setup Vite
[ ] Dashboard with stats:
  [ ] Allows to configure load balancer via RCP
  [ ] Pool / config management
  [ ] Request Flow
    [ ] React Flow
    [ ] Extract common logic from CLI to separate lib
    [ ] Displays connected servers in real time
    [ ] Displays them on graph
    [ ] Displays health checks that are made to each server
    [ ] Allows to communicate with test servers in real time
      [ ] Timeout
      [ ] 500
      [ ] shutdown
      [ ] Add new one
  [ ] Timeout management
[ ] Figure out the best way to deploy React app
  [ ] Serve from Bun?
  [ ] Separate deployment?
  [ ] Do I want to SSR some secrets used to auth with dashboard?
[ ] Monorepo
[ ] Handle case when there is no servers in pool - currently error
[ ] Config should be persistent so after restarting load balancer servers do not need - also nice for development as watch breaks stuff
[ ] Fix mutable config - better types?
[ ] Global timeout settings
[ ] Introduce pino for logging
  [ ] Standard access logs on stub server
[ ] Auto register
  [ ] Add Basic Auth
  [ ] Use different protocol for communication - some RPC would be much better
  [ ] Allow to configure API port + allow to enable / disable auto registration mode
  [ ] Make sure that server lives when registering
  [ ] Deduplicate servers - not only id but also do not allow same configuration
  [ ] Graceful shutdown + deregister
  [ ] Typing + separate package for registering
[ ] Deployment to fly.io
  [ ] X-Forwarded-IP header or something - to make sure it works
  [ ] Fly launch for
[ ] Security considerations
  [ ] For example should any of the headers be actually removed?
  [ ] OAuth / JWKS / Basic Auth - only load balancer is actually secured
  [ ] Configurable via dashboard
[ ] Changesets -> https://github.com/changesets/changesets
[ ] Should I repeat failed request against different server
[ ] HTTPS support? Out of the box?
[ ] Circuit breaker pattern
[ ] Code improvements:
  [ ] Modularize code please. Make better use of closures and functions
  [ ] Should server pool be it's own class / type? It should handle health checks by itself
[ ] CLI improvements:
  [ ] Logs streaming
  [ ] Fuzzy search
  [ ] Actual URL to be displayed
  [ ] Custom select component - separator and disabled options
  [ ] Custom wait until button press component
  [ ] Better handle errors and cancellations like CTRL+C
  [ ] Make sure that after stop, entry is removed from servers.txt
  [ ] Small refactor if needed:
    [ ] More types etc
    [ ] Split commands into files???
[ ] Support for different modules
  [ ] Health Check
  [ ] Rate Limiter
  [ ] Whatever user might need
  [ ] Check nginx modules
[ ] Metrics (Sentry?)
  [ ] Number of connections for each server
[ ] Tests
  [ ] Unit
  [ ] Load testing
[ ] XState maybe?
[ ] Documentation
[ ] Support horizontal scaling
[ ] Support for streaming / different http features?
[ ] Rate Limiter
  [ ] IP only
  [ ] per path config
  [ ] x requests in time
  [ ] Geo IP
  [ ] config live!
[ ] Auth Support
  [ ] JWT
  [ ] OAuth maybe?
[ ] MonoRepo?
[ ] Maybe TCP mode? Bun supports
